## Welcome to my GitHub Pages site

Hello guys.
I let you access my [GitHub Editor](https://github.com/Kilam023/Kilam023.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to make you understand how this site works.

This site [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) could make the beginners and the lazy ones interested.

### Markdown

Markdown ( permits you to insert a "code block". In this one, you can see the Jekyll syntax for differents elements.

```markdown

# Titre 1
## Titre 2
### Titre 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

**_IMPORTANT_** For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my [repository settings]. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
